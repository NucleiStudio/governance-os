refer to those labels. Handles constant-pool island insertion and also
veneer insertion for out-of-range jumps.</p>
<p>This code exists to solve three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Branch targets for forward branches are not known until later, when we
emit code in a single pass through the instruction structs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On many architectures, address references or offsets have limited range.
For example, on AArch64, conditional branches can only target code +/- 1MB
from the branch itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lowering of control flow from the CFG-with-edges produced by
<a href="../blockorder/struct.BlockLoweringOrder.html">BlockLoweringOrder</a>, combined with many empty
edge blocks when the register allocator does not need to insert any
spills/reloads/moves in edge blocks, results in many suboptimal branch
patterns. The lowering also pays no attention to block order, and so
two-target conditional forms (cond-br followed by uncond-br) can often by
avoided because one of the targets is the fallthrough. There are several
cases here where we can simplify to use fewer branches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This “buffer” implements a single-pass code emission strategy (with a later
“fixup” pass, but only through recorded fixups, not all instructions). The
basic idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emit branches as they are, including two-target (cond/uncond) compound
forms, but with zero offsets and optimistically assuming the target will be
in range. Record the “fixup” for later. Targets are denoted instead by
symbolic “labels” that are then bound to certain offsets in the buffer as
we emit code. (Nominally, there is a label at the start of every basic
block.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we do this, track the offset in the buffer at which the first label
reference “goes out of range”. We call this the “deadline”. If we reach the
deadline and we still have not bound the label to which an unresolved branch
refers, we have a problem!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To solve this problem, we emit “islands” full of “veneers”. An island is
simply a chunk of code inserted in the middle of the code actually produced
by the emitter (e.g., vcode iterating over instruction structs). The emitter
has some awareness of this: it either asks for an island between blocks, so
it is not accidentally executed, or else it emits a branch around the island
when all other options fail (see <code>Inst::EmitIsland</code> meta-instruction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A “veneer” is an instruction (or sequence of instructions) in an “island”
that implements a longer-range reference to a label. The idea is that, for
example, a branch with a limited range can branch to a “veneer” instead,
which is simply a branch in a form that can use a longer-range reference. On
AArch64, for example, conditionals have a +/- 1 MB range, but a conditional
can branch to an unconditional branch which has a +/- 128 MB range. Hence, a
conditional branch’s label reference can be fixed up with a “veneer” to
achieve a longer range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To implement all of this, we require the backend to provide a <code>LabelUse</code>
type that implements a trait. This is nominally an enum that records one of
several kinds of references to an offset in code – basically, a relocation
type – and will usually correspond to different instruction formats. The
<code>LabelUse</code> implementation specifies the maximum range, how to patch in the
actual label location when known, and how to generate a veneer to extend the
range.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That satisfies label references, but we still may have suboptimal branch
patterns. To clean up the branches, we do a simple “peephole”-style
optimization on the fly. To do so, the emitter (e.g., <code>Inst::emit()</code>)
informs the buffer of branches in the code and, in the case of conditionals,
the code that would have been emitted to invert this branch’s condition. We
track the “latest branches”: these are branches that are contiguous up to
the current offset. (If any code is emitted after a branch, that branch or
run of contiguous branches is no longer “latest”.) The latest branches are
those that we can edit by simply truncating the buffer and doing something
else instead.</p>
<p>To optimize branches, we implement several simple rules, and try to apply
them to the “latest branches” when possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A branch with a label target, when that label is bound to the ending
offset of the branch (the fallthrough location), can be removed altogether,
because the branch would have no effect).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unconditional branch that starts at a label location, and branches to
another label, results in a “label alias”: all references to the label bound
<em>to</em> this branch instruction are instead resolved to the <em>target</em> of the
branch instruction. This effectively removes empty blocks that just
unconditionally branch to the next block. We call this “branch threading”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conditional followed by an unconditional, when the conditional branches
to the unconditional’s fallthrough, results in (i) the truncation of the
unconditional, (ii) the inversion of the condition’s condition, and (iii)
replacement of the conditional’s target (using the original target of the
unconditional). This is a fancy way of saying “we can flip a two-target
conditional branch’s taken/not-taken targets if it works better with our
fallthrough”. To make this work, the emitter actually gives the buffer
<em>both</em> forms of every conditional branch: the true form is emitted into the
buffer, and the “inverted” machine-code bytes are provided as part of the
branch-fixup metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unconditional B preceded by another unconditional P, when B’s label(s) have
been redirected to target(B), can be removed entirely. This is an extension
of the branch-threading optimization, and is valid because if we know there
will be no fallthrough into this branch instruction (the prior instruction
is an unconditional jump), and if we know we have successfully redirected
all labels, then this branch instruction is unreachable. Note that this
works because the redirection happens before the label is ever resolved
(fixups happen at island emission time, at which point latest-branches are
cleared, or at the end of emission), so we are sure to catch and redirect
all possible paths to this instruction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="branch-optimization-correctness" class="section-header"><a href="#branch-optimization-correctness">Branch-optimization Correctness</a></h1>
<p>The branch-optimization mechanism depends on a few data structures with
invariants, which are always held outside the scope of top-level public
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The latest-branches list. Each entry describes a span of the buffer
(start/end offsets), the label target, the corresponding fixup-list entry
index, and the bytes (must be the same length) for the inverted form, if
conditional. The list of labels that are bound to the start-offset of this
branch is <em>complete</em> (if any label has a resolved offset equal to <code>start</code>
and is not an alias, it must appear in this list) and <em>precise</em> (no label
in this list can be bound to another offset). No label in this list should
be an alias.  No two branch ranges can overlap, and branches are in
ascending-offset order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The labels-at-tail list. This contains all MachLabels that have been bound
to (whose resolved offsets are equal to) the tail offset of the buffer.
No label in this list should be an alias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The label_offsets array, containing the bound offset of a label or
UNKNOWN. No label can be bound at an offset greater than the current
buffer tail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The label_aliases array, containing another label to which a label is
bound or UNKNOWN. A label’s resolved offset is the resolved offset
of the label it is aliased to, if this is set.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We argue below, at each method, how the invariants in these data structures
are maintained (grep for “Post-invariant”).</p>
<p>Given these invariants, we argue why each optimization preserves execution
semantics below (grep for “Preserves execution semantics”).</p>
