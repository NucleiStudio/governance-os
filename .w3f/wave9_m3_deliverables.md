| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
| 0a. | License | [../LICENSE](../LICENSE) | We chose the Apache 2.0 license as initially agreed. |
| 0b. | Documentation | https://nucleistudio.github.io/governance-os/governance_os_node/index.html | The code contains inline rust documentation. Additionally, we use a github action to auto publish it. In addition to the rust code documentation, the `./app` folder which contains the JS based frontend also includes inline documentation. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | [wave9_m3_testing.md](wave9_m3_testing.md) | The guide should cover any manual testing needs for you to confirm the functionalities of the pallets. When it comes to running our unit tests a simple `cargo test --all` should be enough. It also includes details on how to run a local frontend server. |
| 1. | React JS based frontend | [../app](../app) | This folder contains the React JS frontend code. It is based on the Substrate Frontend Template so the structure and feel should be familiar to you. |
| 2. | Demonstration Chain | [../runtime](../runtime) and [../node](../node) | We tried to keep the runtime as minimal as possible; it doesn't rely on the `balances` pallet which is **fully replaced** by our `tokens` pallet. We have also defined some default bylaws roles such as `Root` or `CreateCurrencies`. You may need to use the types available in [../types.json](../types.json) when testing. There were no changes to it since milestone 2. |
| 3. | Dockerfile | [../Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) | You can build the container as usual. We also have a public image being built thanks to a little overnight [automation system](https://github.com/ETeissonniere/substrate-nodeops/), you can grab the public image under the name [`eteissonniere/governance-os`](https://hub.docker.com/r/eteissonniere/governance-os). This dockerfile only contains the node itself, you have to run the frontend separately. |
