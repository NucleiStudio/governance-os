| 0a. | License | [../LICENSE](../LICENSE) | We chose the Apache 2.0 license as initially agreed. |
| 0b. | Documentation | https://nucleistudio.github.io/governance-os/governance_os_node/index.html | The code contains inline rust documentation. Additionally, we use a github action to auto publish it. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide |  | The guide should cover any manual testing needs for you to confirm the functionalities of the pallets. When it comes to running our unit tests a simple `cargo test --all` should be enough. |
| 1. | `tokens` pallet | [../pallets/tokens](../pallets/tokens) | This pallet is able to handle an arbitrary number of currencies. It also exposes an adapter implementing the `Currency` and `ReservableCurrency` traits for a given token for compatibility purposes. It then exposes similar interfaces with multiple currencies support built in. It will let people manage tokens as well (i.e. make them transferable or not, minting or burning some units) by using the `bylaws` pallet for access control management. |
| 2. | `bylaws` pallet | [../pallets/bylaws](../pallets/bylaws) | This pallet saw quite some changes in a month! We initially started with a tagging and filtering system by hooking straight inside the `SignedExtra` portion of the runtime (see #16). We then refactored it to switch to a simpler role based system + call tagging system (#17) along with support for other pallets defining their custom roles. Finally #18 and #19 ended up dropping the complex call tagging system and deprecating support for the `SignedExtra` in favor of a more robust UNIX like system (basically, accounts gets associated to roles which allows them to perform certain actions).  We feature a `WeightInfo` like system for runtime developers to customize the roles exposed and used by their runtime and fully support the customization and configuration of those both at Genesis and on the fly. We have also added a pallet named [`compat`](../pallets/compat) to support a `sudo` based workflow for admin operations but using our own permissioning system. |
| 3. | Demonstration Chain | [../runtime](../runtime) and [../node](../node) | We tried to keep the runtime as minimal as possible; it doesn't rely on the `balances` pallet which is **fully replaced** by our `tokens` pallet. We have also defined some default bylaws roles such as `Root` or `CreateCurrencies`. You may need to use the types available in [../types.json](../types.json) when testing. |
| 4. | Dockerfile | [../Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) | You can build the container as usual. We also have a public image being built thanks to a little overnight [automation system](https://github.com/ETeissonniere/substrate-nodeops/), you can grab the public image under the name [`eteissonniere/governance-os`](https://hub.docker.com/r/eteissonniere/governance-os). |
