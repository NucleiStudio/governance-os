//! This pallet can be used to deploy a conviction voting system. With
//! conviction voting, votes accumulate and de-accumulate over time via
//! a half life decay curve.
//! It incentivizes people to vote earlier as their votes will have more
//! value over time (up to a certain limit). In our implementation, we
//! have decided that every new vote's conviction will start at 0 and
//! slowly accumulate to whatever the user staked on the proposal. This
//! means that even if they stake a lot of coins they won't be accounted
//! immediately.
