//! This pallet implements a bylaws system for account permissioning.
//! A bylaw is typically made of a "tag" and a "rule". Tags represents
//! the kinds of calls being filtered, for instance an hypothetic tag
//! `Monetary` could refer to all extrinsics moving tokens. A rule is
//! then a simple script implemented in a DSL (typically Rust enums)
//! to help the system decide if the call should be approved or discarded.
//!
//! The bylaws pallet should typically be added to the `SignedExtra` of a
//! runtime so that it could filter incoming calls.
