//! This pallet implements the code to support a multi currency runtime.
//! Along with compatibility with the `Currency` trait through the use
//! of `NativeCurrencyAdapter`.
//! Caveats:
//! - for now, we do not support `reasons` and `existence_requirements`
//! - for now, we do not support `ExistentialDeposit`
//! - for now, we do not support locking or reserving funds
