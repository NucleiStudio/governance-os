//! This module hosts the runtime for the governance OS, it bundles the other
//! pallets from the governance OS project. It aims at providing the following:
//! - a demonstration runtime for anybody willing to test the pallets
//! - a reference runtime for anybody trying to use the pallets in their own runtime

#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
// `construct_runtime!` does a lot of recursion and requires us to increase the limit to 256.
#![recursion_limit = "256"]

// Make the WASM binary available.
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
